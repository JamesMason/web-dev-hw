# Assignment 5

An html class can be used to group together elements from different parts of the page that will all hasve the saem styling applied to them. An ID is also for styling, 
but it can only be used for one element. "Div" is for divide and can be used to break the html into large sections. A span serves similar purpose but instead of big sections of the page, 
it's for making "inline" changes.

The advantage of using third-party hosting (like Youtube) for media is that they take care of the bandwidth and complicated details
necessary to get high-quality media to display online.

For this assignment I chose a silly mashup of Carly Rae Jepsen and Nine Inch Nails-- I thought of it right away because it's on 
Soundcloud and I know from the example (haha) that they will let you embed their media. I got thrown off by bold words in the 
instructions again ("second class") but I was able to 'peek' at the code in the example to see that it literally just means another 
class when there already is one. I added the "src" to the video automatically before finishing the instructions about the source tag 
and had to go back and erase it, which I guess is a good reminder about looking over all the requirements first. When I typed in <source> 
I discovered by accident thagt when I moused over it in Atom, it showed a link from Mozilla I could click to double-check how it worked 
and it was really useful and I'm glad I know now.
