# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo.
## James Mason
I decided to take this class because it is a prerequisite in the Media Arts BFA and I thought it would be easier to get it out of the way in the summer, and because I have no experience with code at all and want to create my own pages on the internet.

But what really is the internet?

- I am surprised that many people think the government or Bill Gates or even service providers control the internet.
- I did not know that the internet was invented in the 1970's as part of national defense research.
