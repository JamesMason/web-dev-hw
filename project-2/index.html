      <h1>A step-by-step guide to a robust art production cycle</h1>
      <p>
        This guide will walk you through, in broad strokes, some of the hard-won
        knowledge I've picked up on drawing techniques and materials over the
        last several decades.

            Always work from reference materials and try to draw what you see, not what you know.

             Draw your subject with your lighter drawing pencils and begin to refine which lines work for you.

             Do a tracing of the best lines that you want to keep instead of erasing the lines you don’t want.

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
             Add shading and contrast and start picking out details. Use your erasers for drawing highlights
             more than for correction. Use the blending stumps to draw rounded surfaces without making hard
             lines, also great for shading.

             Adjust the size of the image to fit your 8 ½ x 11 area if needed and use the tools available to clean up your background of any smudges. Save as a high quality jpg.

        <tr>
          <td>
             Print your image on a sheet of marker paper, preferably on the non waxy side. This will give you a fully shaded and detailed drawing that you can render on.
          </td>
          <td>
            <a href="#final-paper">10</a>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Use the lightest prismacolor pencils to pick out your highlights first, such as the whites of eyes. This leaves a bright layer that you can get back if you accidently render over it. Use the markers to fill in larger areas, and use complimentary gradient colors that blend well together. Try this on a scratch piece of paper first.
          </td>
          <td>
            <a href="color">11</a>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Use the colored pencils to pick out fine details. You may have to do more shading and building of layers to get the look you want.  Don’t be afraid of making mistakes, because you can always print out another drawing.
          </td>
          <td>
            <a href="color">11</a>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
             When finished, scan your work again and make any adjustments you need to in photoshop. The drawing can be digitally cut out and composited with other pieces of art at this point.
          </td>
          <td>
            <a href="#scanner">8, 9</a>
