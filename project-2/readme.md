# Project 2

Learning HTML has honestly been kind of tedious at times, but now that I've got more used to it, it's starting to be fun to put in the code
to make the things I want appear on the page-- like magic! I can see why people use Squarespace and services like that instead of bothering with it, though. 

It's really hard for me as a visual artist to have to look at and put my name on all these pages that don't look at all like I'd want them
to in a design sense, and I figured out pretty fast that CSS has the parts I was really looking forward to getting out of this class. I don't
think I will have the time to finish them before the deadline for grades, but I would still like to come back to the lessons for CSS when my 
other responsibilities let up.

I made a lot of mistakes in this project and I wish I'd had a better idea of how things were going to look. If I could do it over again,
I would have laid it out on paper first-- then I would have dopne the table with the instructions & materials differently because I wouldn't have been
worried about linking there, for example, I ended up doing moire work than I needed to and not really liking the end result. I did enjoy how easy it
was to make the menu look (at least, structure-wise) like the ones that are actually on the web where the page you're on is in bold and the rest
are links. I'm sure there's an easier way to do it out there but since it was only three pages, it was satisfying.

I thought I could just do the minimum of styling because I'm running out of time, but when I saw this I couldn't just leave it:

I'm still not happy with how it looks but I have kids and a life, so, that's it for now.
