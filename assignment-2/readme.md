# Assignment 2

A Version Control System is software that helps web developers make changes to
files and automatically keeps track of those changes over time. The reason we're
using GIT in this class is so that we can fix our mistakes more easily, share our
work and see what it would look like on an actual website, and get used to using
it because it is the industry standard.

Work cycle: the first time I tried to do this assignment, I actually missed a
whole chunk of it because I didn't get how the class website was supposed to
work yet.

Also Github seemed kind of confusing at first so I'm pushing a bunch of these at
once now but now that I know for sure I'm not doing it wrong (anymore) it seems
easy. I had to make changes to this readme because I didn't realize you had to 
capitalize the .PNG part for it to show up correctly.
